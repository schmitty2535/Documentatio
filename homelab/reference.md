# Reference

<details>

<summary>Create Users</summary>

To create a new user account, invoke the `useradd` command followed by the name of the user.

For example to create a new user named `username` you would run:

```
sudo useradd username
```



To be able to log in as the newly created user, you need to set the user password. To do that run the [`passwd`](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-change-user-password-in-linux/) command followed by the username:

```
sudo passwd username
```



On most Linux distributions, when creating a new user account with `useradd`, the userâ€™s home directory is not created.

Use the `-m` (`--create-home`) option to create the user home directory as `/home/username`:

```
sudo useradd -m username
```
